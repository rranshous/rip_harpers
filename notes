### TESTS ON SADO

threaded one year @ a time, one thread per arg: 5m10s, 3m37s
hard dips of almost no cpu usage while waiting for batch response
hard spikes of network usage as all the requests returned

threaded one year @ a time, 1/4 thread per arg: 5m32s, 3m17s
still show dips in cpu, not as hard, flux over larger hills
higher frequency of spikes, not constant

## strangly in tests both cps would go up and down ~together

threaded 1/4 thread per years, 1/4 thread per month: 4m32s, 3m39s
not quite pegged but close
network hits 0 less often, still not constant

threaded 1 thread per year, 1 thread per month: 5m6s, 3m57s
cpu pegged upon initial response set, than has dips like
the first test. than evens out to have cpu like the 3rd test
network addapter never hits 0, each thread takes 11MB of memory
after all requests come in cpu's pegged

non-threaded: 9m59s, 3m37s
cpu stays around 70% shaking wildly
each network call comes in one after the next

## their servers must love this
